# Weather-Forecasting-using-ML-and-Node-MCU-8266
weather forecasting using ML &amp; Node MCU 8266 module
To complete this project you will need to read the whole details of project on my blog Enjoy Engineering.

notes:
the GUI built in the ensemble code used images format ppm
you have to prepare your dataset before you start in form of CSV "comma separated value", where it's easier to manipulate
atthe end of some used algorithms you will find code lines to convert the prediction results again into a CSV file
